# AgroTrack+ Phase 2: AI/ML & Data Intelligence Requirements

## Introduction

Phase 2 transforms AgroTrack+ from a transactional platform into an intelligent, predictive system. Building on the solid operational foundation of Phase 1, we now leverage the accumulated data to provide AI-driven insights, automated decision-making, and predictive capabilities that significantly enhance operational efficiency and user experience.

## Strategic Context

**Guiding Principle: Activating Intelligence**
Phase 1 created a powerful data collection engine. Phase 2 uses that data to bring the platform's AI/ML features to life, moving from historical reporting to predictive forecasting and automated recommendations.

**Design Continuity**
All new UI components must strictly adhere to the established "Modern Organic" design system for seamless user experience.

2. WHEN route performance data is analyzed THEN the system SHALL identify patterns in traffic, delivery delays, and route efficiency
3. WHEN sufficient performance data is collected THEN the route optimization algorithm SHALL automatically update its cost matrix parameters
4. WHEN route planning occurs THEN the system SHALL use machine learning to predict delivery times based on historical performance, time of day, and external factors
5. WHEN route efficiency improves THEN the system SHALL track and report fuel savings, time savings, and delivery performance improvements
6. WHEN delivery issues are reported THEN the system SHALL incorporate this feedback into future route optimization decisions
7. WHEN seasonal patterns affect delivery times THEN the system SHALL automatically adjust routing algorithms for different seasons and weather conditions

### Requirement 5: Advanced Farmer Dashboard v2

**User Story:** As a farmer, I want enhanced dashboard tools for cost tracking and yield analysis so that I can better understand my farm's profitability and optimize my operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN farmers access their dashboard THEN they SHALL see new tools for input cost tracking (seeds, fertilizer, labor, equipment)
2. WHEN farmers input planted area and harvest data THEN the system SHALL automatically calculate yield per acre based on accepted QC quantities
3. WHEN cost and yield data is available THEN the system SHALL generate profitability analysis and margin calculations per crop
4. WHEN farmers enter seasonal planning data THEN the system SHALL provide crop rotation recommendations based on historical performance
5. WHEN market price data is available THEN the system SHALL show price trends and optimal harvest timing suggestions
6. WHEN farmers view financial summaries THEN they SHALL see ROI analysis, cost breakdowns, and performance comparisons with anonymized peer data
7. WHEN planning future crops THEN farmers SHALL receive AI-powered recommendations for crop selection based on soil, climate, and market conditions

### Requirement 6: IoT Sensor Integration (Pilot Program)
